## 8 Schools Intro

The textbook starts with some theory.
You should take a look!
Let's start with a motivating (canonical) example.
From BDA3 Section 5.5:

> A study was performed for the Educational Testing Service to analyze the effects of special coaching programs on test scores. Separate randomized experiments were performed to estimate the effects of coaching programs for the SAT-V (Scholastic Aptitude TestVerbal) in each of eight high schools. The outcome variable in each study was the score on a special administration of the SAT-V, a standardized multiple choice test administered by the Educational Testing Service and used to help colleges make admissions decisions; the scores can vary between 200 and 800, with mean about 500 and standard deviation about 100. The SAT examinations are designed to be resistant to short-term efforts directed specifically toward improving performance on the test; instead they are designed to reflect knowledge acquired and abilities developed over many years of education. Nevertheless, each of the eight schools in this study considered its short-term coaching program to be successful at increasing SAT scores. Also, there was no prior reason to believe that any of the eight programs was more effective than any other or that some were more similar in effect to each other than to any other.

> The results of the experiments are summarized in [the `DataFrame below`]. All students in the experiments had already taken the PSAT (Preliminary SAT), and allowance was made for differences in the PSAT-M (Mathematics) and PSAT-V test scores between coached and uncoached students. In particular, in each school the estimated coaching effect and its standard error were obtained by an analysis of covariance adjustment (that is, a linear regression was performed of SAT-V on treatment group, using PSAT-M and PSAT-V as control variables) appropriate for a completely randomized experiment. A separate regression was estimated for each school. Although not simple sample means (because of the covariance adjustments), the estimated coaching effects, which we label $y_j$, and their sampling variances, $\sigma^2_j$[...] are obtained by independent experiments and have approximately normal sampling distributions with sampling variances that are known, for all practical purposes, because the sample sizes in all of the eight experiments were relatively large, over thirty students in each school (recall the discussion of data reduction in Section 4.1). Incidentally, an increase of eight points on the SAT-V corresponds to about one more test item correct.

For simplicity, let's denote the treatment effects as $y_j$ and the treatment standard deviations as $\sigma_j$.

**Note**: there are lots of great implementations of this problem on the internet.
For example, this [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Eight_Schools) example and, as always, the [stan docs](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/divergences_and_bias.html)

md"""
There are a few ways that we could think about analyzing this data

## Separate Estimates

We could treat the values from each school as truly separate.
We can plot them:
"""

# ╔═╡ a9315c31-cebb-4ffc-acdb-f88c38083533
p_base = let
	p = plot(
		xlabel="Estimated Treatment Effect",
		ylabel="Probability Density",
	)
	for (j, row) in enumerate(eachrow(data))
		dist = Normal(row.yj, row.σj)
		plot!(p, dist, label=j, linewidth=2, color=colors[j], alpha=0.6)
	end
	p
end

# ╔═╡ e0812f83-0760-4c66-a80f-b7b94a5f2e6e
md"""
Two important insights are

* treating each experiment separately yields confidence intervals that overlap substantially
* credibility questions: do we truly believe that the intervention was *that* much more effective in some schols than others or is this random noise?

## Fully pooled estimate

We can alternatively assume that there is **a single true effect size** and each school is a noisy estimate of that true effect size.
We might call this a "fully pooled" estimate.

The pooled estimate for this true effect size $\overline{y}$ is
```math
\overline{y} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J \frac{y_j}{\sigma_j^2}}{\sum_{j=1}^J \frac{1}{\sigma_j^2}}
```
and the pooled estimate for the variance is
```math
\sigma^2 = \left[\sum_{j=1}^J \frac{1}{\sigma_j^2 y_j}\right]^{-1}
```
plugging in we get
"""

pooled_est = let
	variance = 1 / sum([1 ./ σj^2 for σj in data.σj])
	ymean = (
		sum([yj ./ σj^2 for (yj, σj) in zip(data.yj, data.σj)]) / 
		(1 / variance)
	)
	Normal(ymean, sqrt(variance))
end

# ╔═╡ 31965ae4-0d88-40c3-b491-300c6797cd40
md"Here's that pooled estimate in context:"

# ╔═╡ 35f87dbc-c66a-40c0-9fbd-2208b23fef97

end

# ╔═╡ 10ca8f36-fdd7-49fa-8fa0-01de7fba3f23
md"""
Because we have pooled many estimates, our uncertainty (let's be clear: this is uncertainty in our estimate of $\overline{y}$) is much smaller than the estimate at any individual school.
That makes sense!

One question that this analysis motivates is whether it's be possible to have an estimated effect of $y_j = 28$ just by chance if the coaching effects in all eight schools were really the same?

> To get a feeling for the natural variation that we would expect across eight studies if this assumption were true, suppose the estimated treatment effects are eight independent draws from a normal distribution with mean 8 points and standard deviation 13 points (the square root of the mean of the eight variances $\sigma_j^2$)... These expected effect sizes are consistent with the set of observed effect sizes in Table 5.2. Thus, it would appear imprudent to believe that school 1 really has an effect as large as 28 points.
"""

# ╔═╡ c4499423-cdab-4055-8eec-d2451c6fc78b
md"""
## Limitations

Both of these approaches seem unsatisfactory

* If we believe the separate estimates, we think there's a 50% chance that the effect that school 1 has an effect *bigger than 28!*
* If we believe the fully pooled model, we believe that 'the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$ that the true effect in school 1 is less than 7.7'

## Hierarchical Model

This borrows heavily of section 5.4 of BDA3 -- see the text for details (note that the notation here is dramatically simplified)!

What if we didn't have to choose between these two extremes?
We could have a blended estimate:
```math
\theta_j = \lambda_j y_j + (1 − \lambda_j)\overline{y}
```
for some $\lambda_j \in [0, 1]$.
"""

# ╔═╡ 2eb0e370-bccb-437a-9892-5d66da07b381


# ╔═╡ 35dcc98e-4fd0-4ffb-b2a8-1731d4a4ffa0
md"""
If we call our effects at each school $\theta_j$, we could model this as
```math
\begin{align}
p(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_J | \mu, \tau) &= \prod_{j=1}^J N(\theta_j | \mu, \tau^2) \\
p(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_J) &= \int \left[\prod_{j=1}^J N(\theta_j | \mu, \tau^2) \right] p(\mu, \tau) d(\mu, \tau)
\end{align}
```
what is this saying?

1. There is some true average effect $\mu$
1. There is some inter-school variance parameter $\tau$
1. The $\theta_j$ are conditionally independent given $(\mu,  \tau)$.

As we write down a full model, it turns out there are advantages to this "non-centered parameterization"; see [Stan Docs](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/divergences_and_bias.html).
In a non-centered parameterization we do not try to fit the group-level parameters directly, rather we fit a latent Gaussian variable from which we can recover the group-level parameters with a scaling and a translation,
```math
\begin{align}
\mu &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 10) \\
\tau &\sim \mathrm{Cauchy}^+(0, 5) \\
\tilde\theta_j &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\theta_j &= \mu + \tau \tilde \theta_j \\
y_j &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\theta_j, \sigma_j)
\end{align}
```
where $\sigma_j$ is the known uncertainty estimate for that shcool.
