## Cheat sheets on the web

## Helpful stats codes

- Code examples from the Statistical Rethinking book have been coded in `Turing.jl` [here](https://statisticalrethinkingjulia.github.io/TuringModels.jl/) (the original is R)
- the [Stan users guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_28/reference-manual/index.html) offers detailed and practical advice on probabilistic modeling using the Stan language, which is similar to `Turing.jl` in many ways.
- the [`Turing.ml` tutorials](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/) offer an introduction to modeling with Turing
- the [Earth and Environmental Data Science](earth-env-data-science.github.io/) textbook by Ryan Abernathey and colleagues is freely available online. This is a very different _and complementary_ take on data science from this course (it's a big field). If you're looking for best practices in the analysis of gridded climate data, you should check out this course.

## Julia tips and tricks

- the MIT course [Intro to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) was an inspiration for the digital organization of this course and offers great lectures on a number of computational and mathematical tools
- [Dr. Tim Holy](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/timothy-holy-phd/) has a course called [Advanced Scientific Computing: Producing Better Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4oi0IKf52w&list=PL-G47MxHVTewUm5ywggLvmbUCNOD2RbKA) that provides intermediate to advanced tips and tricks
