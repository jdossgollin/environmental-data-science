## Cheat sheets on the web

1. JuliaDocs: [Fastrack to Julia](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/) cheatsheet
1. [QuantEcon group](https://quantecon.org): [MATLAB-Julia-Python comparative cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/)

## Helpful stats codes

1. Code examples from the Statistical Rethinking book have been coded in `Turing.jl` [here](https://statisticalrethinkingjulia.github.io/TuringModels.jl/) (the original is R)
1. the [Stan users guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_28/reference-manual/index.html) offers detailed and practical advice on probabilistic modeling using the Stan language, which is similar to `Turing.jl` in many ways.
1. the [`Turing.ml` tutorials](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/) offer an introduction to modeling with Turing
1. the [Earth and Environmental Data Science](earth-env-data-science.github.io/) textbook by Ryan Abernathey and colleagues is freely available online. This is a very different _and complementary_ take on data science from this course (it's a big field). If you're looking for best practices in the analysis of gridded climate data, you should check out this course.
1. Austin Rochford has a series of [blog posts](https://austinrochford.com/posts/intro-prob-prog-pymc.html) that use the PyMC language (in Python) to teach some introductory probabilistic computing concepts. It's worth a look if you want to dig into the (very good!) probabilistic computing ecosystem in Python.

## Julia tips and tricks

- the MIT course [Intro to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) was an inspiration for the digital organization of this course and offers great lectures on a number of computational and mathematical tools
- [Tim Holy](https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/timothy-holy-phd/) has a course called [Advanced Scientific Computing: Producing Better Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4oi0IKf52w&list=PL-G47MxHVTewUm5ywggLvmbUCNOD2RbKA) that provides intermediate to advanced tips and tricks

## Other sources

1. [Micahel Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/) has a number of highly detailed essays on probabilistic computing (using R) that I highly recommend. They are quite technical, so be warned.
1. The wiki for the stan probabilistic programming language (a gold standard although sometimes tricky to work with) has a set of [prior choice recommendations](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations) that is a go-to reference.
1. More generally, the [documentation](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/) for the stan language has a number of detailed and well-worked examples. It's a fantastic reference for building any kind of probabilistic model, even if you're going to use a different language (with a few exceptions, these models should be fairly straightforward to translate from one language to another)
1. Similarly, the Turing language has some good [tutorials](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/) that are worth looking at

## Note

This is **not** a diverse set of readings.
This reflects both my own narrow knowledge of the field, and also broader problems of inclusion (not to mention justice, equity, etc.) in the fields of statistics, data science, etc.
