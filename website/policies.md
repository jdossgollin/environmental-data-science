# Course Policies

**This should be a living document.**
If you have any suggestions for changes to this document, email me -- changes are encouraged!

## Course organization

Basic information:

1. Classes will be held Tuesday and Thursday from 2:30-3:45PM
1. Office hours will held weekly at a time to be determined

This course will combine synchronous and asynchronous learning

1. Asynchronous lectures will be released on Fridays.  This lecture will be paired with a code notebook (you'll learn about those) that will be posted on this website. You should run  the code in time with the asynchronous lecture.
1. On Tuesdays we will review content, answer questions, and work on practice problems (related to the homework).
1. Homeworks will be due on Thursday before class. On Thursdays we will review the homework, examine case studies, and preview topics for the next week.
1. This schedule will be modified as needed.

## Course Description

Sensors, satellites, people, robots, and drones collect a wealth of data describing environmental processes relevant for understanding and managing the natural and built environment.
Making sense of these data sets, sometimes vast and sometimes consisting of a few observations, requires integrating domain knowledge, computational methods, and statistical models.
In a nutshell, data science.

The path from data and theory to models, inference, and ultimately decisions is long, winding, and perilous.
In this course, you will learn not only how to fit models, but also how to interpret, critique, improve, and evaluate models and model-based inference.
Specifically, you will learn a principled workflow for using data to inform decisions that:

1. credibly describes the physical processes that generated the data;
1. flexibly makes use of multiple sources of information;
1. transparently communicates imperfect modeling assumptions; and
1. allows you to reason about uncertainty using the language of probability theory.

Applications to water, climate, air, and geologic data will emphasize models for spatial and temporal data.

## Course objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. use reproducible software tools to download, open, and visualize data from publicly available sources;
1. use simulation (“forward modeling”) to compare a generative model to data;
1. use Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods to conduct inference (“inverse modeling”) on generative models of environmental data;
1. identify the assumptions that commonly applied data science methods make, and describe where they are or are not appropriate to model environmental data;
1. clearly and effectively communicate analyses of environmental data to technical and non-technical audiences; and
1. critically interpret statistical analyses of environmental data applied in academic journals, government, and industry.

## Grading

1. Weekly problem sets (50%)
    1. Homeworks will contain both written assignments and Julia data analysis
    1. Problem sets should be submitted as Pluto notebooks to Canvas and are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Since we will discuss homework assignments in class, *late homework will not be accepted.[^latehw]
    1. Students may discuss problem sets with classmates, but must come up with unique solutions and turn in their own answers.
    1. Each homework assignment will be graded for explanation of concepts, code clarity / readability, code accuracy, and technical correctness.
    1. For some assignments, you will be asked to review another student's code and give feedback on code clarity/readability. Peer reviews will not affect your grade, but the quality of the peer review you give will be factored into your homework grade.
    1. Your lowest homework grade will be dropped.
1. Weekly discussions (10%)
    1. To prepare for class on Tuesdays, you should use Canvas to ask a question about the upcoming homework (due Thursday) or material covered in readings / lecture videos.
    1. These will be due every week on Monday at 11:59PM so that your comments can be incorporated into class lecture. Think of these as free points for staying engaged with the class!
    1. Use the Discussions features of Canvas to comment
    1. All discussions are graded as follows:
        1. Thoughtful comments related to class that raise a common challenge or interesting question get 2 points
        1. Comments that ask something already covered or do not engage significantly with the material get 1 point
    1. Your lowest score will be dropped.
1. Three exams (40% total)
    1. The first two will be given in class and the third during the final exam slot.
    1. Exams will emphasize students’ ability to understand and critique statistical methods and their interpretations.
    1. All exams will be weighted equally

## COVID-19

We continue to experience significant uncertainty due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Fortunately, this course is easy to move online as needed.

1. If you are feeling unwell or think you may have been exposed to COVID, **stay home**. I will make sure remote participants are included in class. (But if you're healthy, please come to class if we are meeting in person!)
1. Please follow Rice's health guidance (i.e., masking) fully. This is a basic and non-negotiable part of creating a supportive learning environment.
1. If you or a loved one is sick and you need an accommodation, please reach out. Due dates are not flexible but grading is. Take care of yourself!

We will be flexible and adaptive to maximize your learning while ensuring everyone is safe.

## Required references

There are no assigned textbooks.
Save your money!
However, if you do not have a working laptop that you can bring to class, please contact me ASAP!

## Honor code

In this course, all students will be held to the standards of the Rice Honor Code, a code that you pledged to honor when you matriculated at this institution.
If you are unfamiliar with the details of this code and how it is administered, you should consult the Honor System Handbook at [http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/](http://honor.rice.edu/honor-system-handbook/).
This handbook outlines the University’s expectations for the integrity of your academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.

## Disability Resource Center

If you have a documented disability or other condition that may affect academic performance you should:

1. make sure this documentation is on file with the Disability Resource Center (Allen Center, Room 111 / [adarice@rice.edu](mailto:adarice@rice.edu) / x5841) to determine the accommodations you need; and
1. talk with me to discuss your accommodation needs.

## Other Accommodations

If any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, student athletics, or other non-negotiable scheduling conflict, please let me know ASAP so that we can make arrangements.

[^latehw]: I know this is an unforgiving policy. But it's worth it to be able to discuss homework in class, when it is fresh in everyones' minds. If you're not done, turn in whatever you have. And you can drop your lowest assignment.
