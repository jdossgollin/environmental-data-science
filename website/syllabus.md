# Syllabus

## Credits

> Some material on this website (and the website template itself) is based on: _**Computational Thinking**, a live online Julia/Pluto textbook_
> ([computationalthinking.mit.edu](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu)).

## Topics

In general, content will be presented through readings and asynchronous (video) lectures.
We will use class time to review key concepts, go over theory, answer questions, review each others' work, and answer practice problems.
We will also cover some material through `Live` (in-person, synchronous) lectures.
The following table gives a list of topics that we will cover and the week that we will cover them.

This is an ambitious syllabus; we will adjust as needed!
